#Hi, I'm Jacob

I live in Maine.  I am a father and was a musician at one point in my life. My software development journey began when I lived in Virginia almost 4 years ago and have been thoroughly enjoying the path. I love to create new projects and get excited when I get to build new things. Recently my focus has been getting in anything from HTML and CSS to Javascript and frameworks like NodeJs or databases like MongoDB.
